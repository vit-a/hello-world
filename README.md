Hello, user!

My name is Vera.
I'm working as a data engineer at a big company in Russia.
My —Åolleagues and I work with data... big data!
I like what we do! 
I LIKE DATA! BIG DATA!!! BIG DYNAMIC DATA!!! 
Before I became data engineer I was an accountant.
More than 12 years I was the accountant. 
It was terrible.
Especially last two years. 
I hated my job because every day was nothing new.
It was small static data every day.

Thank you for the reading!
